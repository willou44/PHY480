anyone else on GSL Interpolation Routines? I have no idea how to do Q2
From Andhika Adiantoro to Everyone:  09:47 AM
start by declaring an array like this double x_values[npts] = {1.,2.,3.,4.,};
after that u want to delete the part from the deltax declaration until the for loop that has the sin function in it
From Chrissy Schumm to Everyone:  09:51 AM
Ok!
Is that it for 2? Then the rest of the change to the code is described in Q3
From Andhika Adiantoro to Everyone:  09:53 AM
yes q2 is all about declaring array, in q3 we have to write the function based on equation 9.7 in the notes and spline it
if that makes sense...
From Chrissy Schumm to Everyone:  09:58 AM
It does actually :)
so now we have double x_values[9]= {the x values from the chart}
From Chrissy Schumm to Everyone:  10:05 AM
Yep!

This gsl interpolation is so annoying.
