#  Notes:  
#   * run with: "python run_area_cmdline1.py" or just "./run_area_cmdline1.py"
#   * should check the return code to make sure it worked!
#   * could use Popen instead of call
#   * pass a full string to the shell with the first method below
#      or pass a list of arguments without "shell=True".
