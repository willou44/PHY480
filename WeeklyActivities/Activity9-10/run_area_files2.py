#
#  This python script runs the C++ code area_files for a sequence
#   of values that are hardcoded in the script.  The output is to
#   the screen.  Here the ranges are specified from numpy functions.

#  Revision history:
#      28-Dec-2010  original version from run_area_cmdline2.py
#
#  Notes:  
#   * run with: "python run_area_files2.py" or just "./run_area_files2.py"
#   * should check the return code to make sure it worked!
#   * could use Popen instead of call
#   * pass a full string to the shell with the first method below
#      or pass a list of arguments without "shell=True".
