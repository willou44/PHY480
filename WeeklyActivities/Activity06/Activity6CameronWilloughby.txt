Wrapping GSL Functions: eigen_tridiagonal_class
1. All of the gsl function calls are now in the Hamiltonian class which is in the file GslHamiltonian.h
This is better because this class is now easilly portable to many programs, as well as a decent template for other classes one might make.

2. Yes, the code still works!

3. I would make a function for loading the matrix and for printing the results
