//  file: nan_test.cpp
// 
//  Program to test when programs compiled with g++ return nan's and inf's
//
//  Programmer:  Dick Furnstahl  furnstahl.1@osu.edu
//
//  Revision history:
//      01/24/04  original version, translated from nan_test.c
//      02/01/04  added log(-1.)
//      01/20/06  added examples of combining nan's and inf's
//
//  Notes:
//   * "nan" stands for "not a number"
//   * "inf" stands for infinity
//   * -Werror removed from make_nan_test to allow it to proceed with
//       warning (which may not occur anyway) 
//   * If we explicitly put 0. in a denominator, we would get a compiler
//      warning.  But defining denominator=0. and then using it gets
//      no warning!  (So you can't rely on the compiler for this.)
